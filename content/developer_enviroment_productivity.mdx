This article is about my developer enviroment. Mainly I wrote it to review and improve my daily habbits and to share my expirience with others.

Most of the time I spend in **command line**, writing code in **Vim**, executing commands in **Zsh** shell, which is opened in **Tmux** tab, which is rendered in **Alacritty** terminal emulator and all this is run by **macOS** on my Mac.

## Outline

1. Editor - NVIM
2. Terminal - Alacritty
3. Shell - ZSH
4. Automation - Ansible, Brew

## Editor - VIM (NVIM)

> [Neovim][Neovim Github] - community driven, refactored version of vim.

Vim is my main text editor. It allows me to edit text faster than any other tool. Vim forces to learn right habbits. Hands never take off the keys. Keeping them in an optimum position to input text, to scroll, to navigate or to apply commands.

The way I use Vim:

* Plugin management - [**Vim-Plug**][VimPlug Github]
* File explorer - [**Nerdtree**][Nerdtree Github]
* Navigation / Search - [**FZF**][FZF Github], [**FZF plugin**][FZF Vim Github], [**RipGrep**][RipGrep Github]
* Autocomplete - [**YCM**][YCM Github]
* Linting - [**Ale**][Ale Github]
* Git - [**Fugitive**][Vim Fugitive Github], [**Gitgutter**][Vim GitGutter Github]
* Language integration - LSP

### Plugin management

[**Vim-plug**][VimPlug Github] minimalist vim plugin.

<img src="/static/images/developer_enviroment_productivity/nvim_plug_install.gif" size="medium" shadow round />

Features:

* **On demand plugin loading** - for fast startup. When you open Vim, it loads only needed plugins for particular file type.
* **Fast installation / update** - uses shadow clones, parallel installation.

Example of configuration file:

```viml
Plug 'w0rp/ale' " Load on start
Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'for': 'go' } " Load only for Go files 
Plug 'pangloss/vim-javascript', { 'for': 'javascript' }
Plug 'tpope/vim-fireplace', { 'for': 'clojure' }
Plug 'rust-lang/rust.vim', { 'for': 'rust' }
```

### File tree 

The NERDTree is a tree explorer plugin. It allows you to browse directory hierarchies and manipulate filesystem operations. It presents the filesystem in form of tree, which you navigate in Vim style.

Shortcuts:
```
<leader>n - toggle file tree
<leader>f - find current file
```

While tree is focused
```
t - open file in new tab
i - open file in a hsplit
s - open file in a vsplit
o / enter - open file in main buffer
```

### Navigation / Search - fzf, ripgrep

For quick search and navigation is done via FZF. It is a generic command-line fuzzy finder. It can be used to search in any list: files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits.

From inside of the editor it is used to search for files by filename, by content and to quickly jump between buffers.

*Mappings*:
```viml
<ctrl>p - open search by filename for all files
<ctrl>f - open search by content for all files
<ctrl>b - open searcg by filename for opened buffers
```

### Autocomplete - Ycm

### Linting - Ale

Ale plugin is used for linting. It is async, fast and has wide range of integtions available.

Example of configuration:

```viml
let g:ale_linters = {'typescript': ['eslint', 'tsserver']}
let g:ale_fixers = {'typescript': ['prettier', 'eslint']}
```

Mappings:

```viml
nnoremap <leader>al :ALELint<cr>
nnoremap <leader>af :ALEFix<cr>
nnoremap <leader>ad :ALEDetail<cr>
```

## Terminal - Alacritty

[Alacritty][Alacritty Github] is terminal emulator of my choice. Basically it is GPU rendered window with shell propt. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Terminal Multiplexer - Tmux

<img src="/static/images/developer_enviroment_productivity/tmux_new_pane.gif" size="medium" round shadow />

Alacritty is very minimal. I use it with with Tmux terminal multiplexer, which provides with capabilities to have multiple sessions open, to have multiple tabs in each session and with easy navigation between them.

In tmux, to use shortcuts, 

### Shortcuts

#### Panes

```
create new pane: <prefix>c 
go to pane 1: <prefix>1
go to pane 2: <prefix>2
go to pane N: <prefix>N
```

### Splits

```
vertical split - <ctrl>|
horizontal split - <ctrl>-
```

### Sessions

Navigation between different sessions

```
open session list: <prefix>s 
open session list with tabs: <prefix>w
```

### Navigation

Navigation between splits is done using vim key bindings.

```
go to left split: <ctrl>h
go to right split: <ctrl>l
go to top split: <ctrl>k
go to bottom split: <ctrl>j
```

## Shell - Zsh

## Automation

Installation and configuration of software is done automatically via Ansible provisioning scripts that you can find here. [osx-automation](https://github.com/atsman/osx-automation)
